A GUI for SU (Seismic Unix) and rsf based Madagascar.

Project will initially consist of intermittent code from my thesis.

short term goal is to create minimal dependency python gui modules which can be used in line with seismic unix and/or madagascar.

Current modules are built upon resources available in EPD.

I appreciate any input but my time is limited while I undertake my thesis.
